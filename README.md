This project is a program which allows users to generate a  CSV file with the amount of people they chose.

Once genetated, they can upload the file and have all the people displayed on the home page.

There is also a delete button, which allows the user to delete all the people.

This application uses React, C#, and EFCore.

Packages "CSVHelper" and "Faker" must be installed to get this app running.
